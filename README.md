# CPU-Temp
displays cpu temperature in a nice resizable widget that will change colour and start shaking if temperatures rise

It will stay on top and can be resized with scroll wheel. Dial color will change with rising temperature (above 48 degrees) and temps above 90 degrees cause shaking visual (more violent as temp increases) so it draws more attention to something requiring attention.

Dial "floats" a bit to create an analog effect.
